      <h2>Scope</h2>
      <p>This specification defines a text-based profile of the Timed Text Markup Language version 2.0 [[TTML2]]
        intended to support dubbing and <a>audio description</a> workflows worldwide,
        to meet the requirements defined in [[?DAPT-REQS]], and to permit usage of visual presentation
        features within [[TTML2]] and its profiles, for example those in [[ttml-imsc1.2]].</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <section id="intro-overview">
        <h3>Transcripts and Scripts</h3>
        <p>A <dfn>transcript</dfn> is a text representation of <i>pre-existing</i> media in another form,
          for example the dialogue in a video;
          a <dfn>script</dfn> is a text representation of the <i>intended</i> content of media prior to its creation,
          for example to guide an actor in recording an audio track.
          Within this specification the term <a>DAPT script</a> is used generically to refer to both <a>transcripts</a> and <a>scripts</a>.
          <a>DAPT Scripts</a> consist of timed text and associated metadata,
          such as the character speaking.
        </p>
        <p>In dubbing workflows, a <a>transcript</a> is generated and translated to create a <a>script</a>.
          In audio description workflows, a <a>transcript</a> describes the video image,
          and is then used directly as a <a>script</a> for recording an audio equivalent.
        </p>
        <p>DAPT is a TTML-based format for the exchange of <a>transcripts</a> and <a>scripts</a>
          (i.e. <a>DAPT Scripts</a>)
          among authoring, prompting and playback tools in the localization and <a>audio description</a> pipelines.
          A <dfn>DAPT document</dfn> is a serializable form of a <a>DAPT Script</a> designed to carry pertinent information for dubbing or <a>audio description</a>
          such as type of <a>DAPT script</a>, dialogue, descriptions, timing, metadata, original language transcribed text, translated text, language information, and audio mixing instructions,
          and to be extensible to allow user-defined annotations or additional future features.</p>
        <p>This specification defines the data model for <a>DAPT scripts</a> and
          its representation as a [[TTML2]] document (see [[[#data-model]]])
          with some constraints and restrictions (see [[[#profile-constraints]]]).</p>
        <p>A <a>DAPT script</a> is expected to be used to make audio visual media accessible
          or localized for users who cannot understand it in its original form,
          and to be used as part of the solution for meeting user needs
          involving <a>transcripts</a>, including accessibility needs described in [[media-accessibility-reqs]],
          as well as supporting users who need dialogue translated into a different language via dubbing.</p>
        <p>The authoring workflow for both dubbing and audio description involves similar stages,
          that share common requirements as described in [[dapt-reqs]].
          In both cases, the author reviews the content and
          writes down what is happening, either in the dialogue or in the video image,
          alongside the time when it happens.
          Further transformation processes can change the text to a different language and
          adjust the wording to fit precise timing constraints.
          Then there is a stage in which an audio rendering of the <a>script</a> is generated,
          for eventual mixing into the programme audio.
          That mixing can occur prior to distribution,
          or in the client directly.</p>
        <section id="intro-dubbing">
          <h4>Dubbing <a>scripts</a></h4>
          <p>A <dfn>dubbing script</dfn> is a <a>transcript</a> or <a>script</a>
            (depending on workflow stage) used for
            recording translated dialogue to be mixed with the non-dialogue programme audio,
            to generate a localized version of the programme in a different language,
            known as a dubbed version, or dub for short.
            Creating a <a>dubbing script</a> is a complex, multi-step process involving:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Transcribing and timing the dialogue in the original language from a completed programme to create a <a>transcript</a>;</li>
            <li>Notating dialogue with character information and other annotations;</li>
            <li>Generating localization notes to guide further adaptation;</li>
            <li>Translating the dialogue to a target language <a>script</a>;</li>
            <li>Adapting the translation to the dubbing and subtitling specifications;
              for example matching the actor’s lip movements in the case of dubs and considering reading speeds and shot changes.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><a>Dubbing scripts</a> can be useful as a starting point for creation of subtitles or closed captions in alternate languages.
            This specification is designed to facilitate the addition of, and conversion to,
            subtitle and caption documents in other profiles of TTML, such as [[ttml-imsc1.2]],
            for example by permitting subtitle styling syntax to be carried in <a>DAPT documents</a>.
            Alternatively, styling can be applied to assist voice artists when recording scripted dialogue.

        <section id="intro-audio-description">
          <h4>Audio Description <a>scripts</a></h4>
          <p>Creating audio description content is also a multi-stage process.
            An <dfn>audio description</dfn>,
            also known as video description
            or in [[media-accessibility-reqs]] as <a data-cite="media-accessibility-reqs#described-video">described video</a>,
            is an audio service
            to assist viewers who can not fully see a visual presentation to understand the content.
            It is the result of the audio rendition of one or more <a>descriptions</a>
            mixed with the audio associated with the programme prior to any mixing with audio description
            (sometimes referred to as <dfn>main programme audio</dfn>),
            at moments when this does not clash with dialogue, to deliver an audio description mixed audio track.
            A <dfn>description</dfn> is a set of words that describes an aspect of the programme presentation,
            suitable for rendering into audio by means of vocalisation and recording
            or used as a text alternative source for text to speech translation, as defined in [[WCAG22]].
            More information about what <a>audio description</a> is and how it works can be found at [[BBC-WHP051]].
          </p>
          <p>Writing the audio description <a>script</a> typically involves:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>watching the video content of the programme,
            or series of programmes,</li>
            <li>identifying the key moments during which there is an opportunity to speak descriptions,</li>
            <li>writing the description text to explain the important visible parts of the programme at that time,</li>
            <li>creating an audio version of the descriptions, either by recording a human actor or using text to speech,</li>
            <li>defining mixing instructions (applied using [[ttml2]] audio styling) for combining the audio with the programme audio.</li>
          </ul> 
          <p>The audio mixing can occur prior to distribution of the media,
            or in the client player.
            If the <a>audio description</a> <a>script</a> is delivered to the player,
            the text can be used to provide an alternative rendering,
            for example on a Braille display,
            or using the user's configured screen reader.

        <h3>Example documents</h3>
        <h4>Basic document structure</h4>
        <p>The top level structure of a document is as follows.
          The <code>xmlns</code> attribute and the <code>tt</code> element indicate that this is a TTML document
          and the <code>ttp:contentProflies</code> attribute indicates that it adheres to the DAPT profile defined in this specification.
          The <code>daptm:scriptType</code> attribute indicates the type of <a>DAPT script</a>
          but in this empty example, it is not relevant, as only the structure of the document is shown.
          The structure is applicable to all types of <a>DAPT scripts</a>, dubbing or <a>audio description</a>.</p>
        <pre class="example"
          data-include="examples/intro-top-level.xml"
          data-include-format="text">
        </pre>
        <p>The following examples correspond to the timed text <a>scripts</a> produced
          at each stage of the workflow described in [[DAPT-REQS]].</p>
        <p>The first example shows a <a>script</a> where timed opportunities for descriptions
          or transcriptions have been identified but no text has been written:</p>
        <pre class="example"
          data-include="examples/intro-times-only.xml"
          data-include-format="text">
        </pre>
        <p>The following examples will demonstrate different uses in dubbing and audio description workflows.</p>

        <h4>Audio Description Examples</h4>
        <p>When descriptions are added this becomes a Pre Recording <a>Script</a>:</p>
        <pre class="example"
          data-include="examples/intro-times-and-text.xml"
          data-include-format="text">
        </pre>
        <p>After creating audio recordings, if not using text to speech, instructions for playback
          mixing can be inserted. For example, The gain of "received" audio can be changed before mixing in
          the audio played from inside the <code>span</code>, smoothly
          animating the value on the way in and returning it on the way out:
        </p>
        <pre class="example"
          data-include="examples/intro-script-with-gain.xml"
          data-include-format="text">
        </pre>
        <p>In the above example, the <code>div</code> element's
          <code>begin</code> time becomes the "syncbase" for its child, 
          so the times on the <code>animate</code> and <code>span</code> 
          elements are relative to 25s here.
          The first <code>animate</code> element drops the gain from 1
          to 0.39 over 0.3s, freezing that value after it ends,
          and the second one raises it back in the
          final 0.3s of this description. Then the <code>span</code> is
          timed to begin only after the first audio dip has finished.</p>
        <p>If the audio recording is long and just a snippet needs to be played,
        that can be done using <code>clipBegin</code> and <code>clipEnd</code>.
        If we just want to play the part of the audio from file from 5s to
        8s it would look like:</p>
        <pre class="example"
          data-include="examples/intro-script-with-audio-clipped.xml"
          data-include-format="text">
        </pre>
        <p>Or audio attributes can be added to trigger the text to be spoken:
        </p>
        <pre class="example"
          data-include="examples/intro-script-with-speak.xml"
          data-include-format="text">
        </pre>

        <h4>Dubbing Examples</h4>
        <p>From the basic structure of Example 1, a transcription of the audio programme produces an original language dubbing <a>script</a>,
          which can look as follows. No specific style or layout is defined, and here the focus is on the transcription of the dialogs.
          Characters are identified in the <code>metadata</code> section.</p>
        <pre class="example"
          data-include="examples/intro-original-language.xml"
          data-include-format="text">
        </pre>

        <p>After translating the text, the document is modified. It includes translation text, and
        in this case the original text is preserved. The main document language is changed to indicate
        that the focus is on the translated language:</p>
        <pre class="example"
          data-include="examples/intro-original-language-with-dub-language.xml"
          data-include-format="text">
        </pre>

        <p>The process of adaptation, before recording, could adjust the wording and/or add further timing to assist in the recording.
        The <code>daptm:scriptType</code> attribute is also modified, as in the following example:</p>
        <pre class="example"
          data-include="examples/intro-original-language-with-dub-language-and-adaptation.xml"
          data-include-format="text">
        </pre>

          A <a>Document Instance</a> MAY be associated with a <dfn>Related Video Object</dfn>, i.e. a <dfn data-cite="ttml2#terms-related-media-object">Related Media Object</dfn> that consists of a sequence of image frames, each a rectangular array of pixels.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          While this specification contains specific provisions when a <a>Document Instance</a> is associated with a <a>Related Video Object</a>, it does not prevent the use of a <a>Document Instance</a> with other kinds of <a>Related Media Object</a>, e.g. an audio only object.

          Each <dfn data-cite="ttml2#terms-intermediate-synchronic-document">Intermediate Synchronic Document</dfn> of the <a>Document Instance</a> is intended to be rendered starting on a specific frame and removed by a specific frame of the Related Video Object.
        </p>
        <p class="note">In the context of this specification rendering could be visual presentation of text,
          for example to show an actor what words to speak, or could be audible playback of an audio resource,
          or could be physical or haptic, such as a Braille display.

        <p>
          When mapping a media time expression M to a frame F of a <a>Related Video Object</a> (or <a>Related Media Object</a>),
          e.g. for the purpose of mixing audio sources signalled by a <a>Document Instance</a> into the <a>main programme audio</a> of the <a>Related Video Object</a>,
          the <a>presentation processor</a> MUST map M to the frame F with the presentation time that is the closest to, but not less, than M.
        </p>
        <p>
          EXAMPLE 1
          A media time expression of 00:00:05.1 corresponds to frame ceiling( 5.1 × ( 1000 / 1001 × 30) ) = 153 of a <a>Related Video Object</a> with a frame rate of 1000 / 1001 × 30 ≈ 29.97.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          In typical scenario, the same video program (the <a>Related Video Object</a>) will be used for <a>Document Instance</a> authoring, delivery and user playback.
          The mapping from media time expression to <a>Related Video Object</a> above allows the author to precisely associate <a>audio description</a> content with video frames, e.g. around existing audio dialogue and sound effects.
          In circumstances where the video program is downsampled during delivery, the application can specify that, at playback, the relative video object be considered the delivered video program upsampled to is original rate, thereby allowing audio content to be presented at the same temporal locations it was authored.

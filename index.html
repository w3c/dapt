      This specification defines <abbr title="Dubbing and Audio description Profiles of TTML2">DAPT</abbr>, a <abbr title="Timed Text Markup Language">TTML</abbr>-based file format for the exchange of timed text content in dubbing and audio description workflows.

      <h2>Scope</h2>
      <p>This specification defines a text-based profile of the Timed Text Markup Language version 2.0 [[TTML2]]
        intended to support dubbing and <a>audio description</a> workflows worldwide,
        to meet the requirements defined in [[[?DAPT-REQS]]], and to permit usage of visual presentation
        features within [[TTML2]] and its profiles, for example those in [[ttml-imsc1.2]].</p>
    </section>

    <section class="informative" id="introduction">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Creating a dub is a complex, multi-step process that involves:
        <ul>
          <li>Transcribing and timing the dialogue in the original language from a completed programme to create a source transcription text</li>
          <li>Notating dialogue with character information and other annotations</li>
          <li>Generating localization notes to guide further adaptation</li>
          <li>Translating the dialogue to a target language</li>
          <li>Adapting the translation to the dubbing and subtitling specifications; ex. matching the actor’s lip movements in the case of dubs and considering reading speeds and shot changes.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>The result of creating a <a>dubbing script</a> can be useful as a starting point for creation of subtitles or closed captions in alternate languages.
        This specification is designed to facilitate the addition of, and conversion to,
        subtitle and caption documents in other profiles of TTML, such as [[ttml-imsc1.2]],
        for example by permitting subtitle styling syntax to be carried in DAPT documents.
        Alternatively, styling can be applied to assist voice artists when recording scripted dialogue or <a>audio descriptions</a>.
      </p>
      <p>Creating audio description content is also a complex process with similar steps.
        An <dfn>audio description</dfn>, also known as video description, is an audio service
        to assist viewers who can not fully see a visual presentation to understand the content.
        It is the result of the audio rendition of one or more <a>descriptions</a>
        mixed with the audio associated with the programme prior to any mixing with audio description
        (sometimes referred to as <dfn>main programme audio</dfn>),
        at moments when this does not clash with dialogue, to deliver an <dfn>audio description mixed audio track</dfn>.
        A <dfn>description</dfn> is a set of words that describe an aspect of the programme presentation,
        suitable for rendering into audio by means of vocalisation and recording
        or used as a text alternative source for text to speech translation, as defined in [[WCAG20]].
        More information about what <a>audio description</a> is and how it works can be found at [[WHP051]].
      </p>
      <p class="issue" data-number="28"></p>
      <p>This specification defines DAPT, a TTML-based format for the exchange of timed text content among authoring and prompting tools in the localization and <a>audio description</a> pipeline.
        A DAPT file is designed to carry pertinent information for dubbing or <a>audio description</a> such as type of script, dialogue, descriptions, timing, metadata, original language text, transcribed text, language information, and to be extensible for future annotations.
        This specification first defines the data model (see [[[#data-model]]]) for DAPT scripts and then its representation as a TTML document with restrictions (see [[[#ttml-format]]]).</p>

      <section id="intro-example">
        <h3>Example documents</h3>
        <p class="ednote">Do we need examples with metadata e.g. script type?</p>
        <p class="issue" data-number="48"></p>
        <p>The top level structure of a document is as follows:</p>
        <pre class="example"
          data-include="examples/intro-top-level.xml"
          data-include-format="text">
        </pre>
        <p>The following examples correspond to the timed text scripts produced
          at each stage of the workflow described in [[DAPT-REQS]].</p>
        <p>The first example shows a script where timed opportunities for descriptions
          or transcriptions have been identified but no text has been written:</p>
        <pre class="example"
          data-include="examples/intro-times-only.xml"
          data-include-format="text">
        </pre>
        <p>When descriptions or transcriptions are added this becomes a Pre Recording Script: Text with times, or Original language Text with times:</p>
        <pre class="example"
          data-include="examples/intro-times-and-text.xml"
          data-include-format="text">
        </pre>
        <p>After translating the text, this becomes Text in original language and dub language with times:</p>
        <pre class="example"
          data-include="examples/intro-original-language-with-dub-language.xml"
          data-include-format="text">
        </pre>
        <p>After creating audio recordings, if not using text to speech, instructions for playback
          mixing can be inserted. For example, The gain of "received" audio can be changed before mixing in
          the audio played from inside the <code>span</code>, smoothly
          animating the value on the way in and returning it on the way out:
        </p>
        <pre class="example"
          data-include="examples/intro-script-with-gain.xml"
          data-include-format="text">
        </pre>
        <p>In the above example, the <code>div</code> element's
          <code>begin</code> time becomes the "syncbase" for its child, 
          so the times on the <code>animate</code> and <code>span</code> 
          elements are relative to 25s here.
          The first <code>animate</code> element drops the gain from 1
          to 0.39 over 0.3s, freezing that value after it ends,
          and the second one raises it back in the
          final 0.3s of this description. Then the <code>span</code> is
          timed to begin only after the first audio dip has finished.</p>
        <p>If the audio recording is long and just a snippet needs to be played,
        that can be done using <code>clipBegin</code> and <code>clipEnd</code>.
        If we just want to play the part of the audio from file from 5s to
        8s it would look like:</p>
        <pre class="example"
          data-include="examples/intro-script-with-audio-clipped.xml"
          data-include-format="text">
        </pre>
        <p>Or audio attributes can be added to trigger the text to be spoken:
        </p>
        <pre class="example"
          data-include="examples/intro-script-with-speak.xml"
          data-include-format="text">
        </pre>

    <section id="conventions">
      <h2>Documentation Conventions</h2>
      <p>
        This document uses the same conventions as [[TTML2]] for the specification of parameter attributes, styling attributes and metadata elements. In particular:
      </p>
      <p>
        Section 2.3 of [[TTML2]] specifies conventions used in the [[XML]] representation of elements; and
        Sections 6.2 and 8.2 of [[TTML2]] specify conventions used when specifying the syntax of attribute values.
      </p>
      <p>
        All content of this specification that is not explicitly marked as non-normative is considered to be normative.
        If a section or appendix header contains the expression "non-normative", then the entirety of the section or appendix is considered non-normative.
      </p>
      <p>
        This specification uses <dfn data-cite="ttml2#terms-feature">Feature</dfn> designations as defined in Appendices E at [[TTML2]]:
        when making reference to content conformance, these designations refer to the syntactic expression or the semantic capability associated with each designated <a>Feature</a>; and
        when making reference to processor conformance, these designations refer to processing requirements associated with each designated <a>Feature</a>.
        If the name of an element referenced in this specification is not namespace qualified, then the TT namespace applies (see <a href="#namespaces">9.3 Namespaces</a>.)

      <h2>DAPT Data Model and corresponding TTML syntax</h2>
      <p>This section specifies the data model for DAPT and its corresponding TTML syntax. In the model, there are objects which can have properties and be associated with other objects. In the TTML syntax, these objects and properties are expressed as elements and attributes.</p>
      <section>
        <h3>DAPT Script</h3>
          <p>A <dfn>DAPT Script</dfn> corresponds to a document processed within an authoring workflow or processed by a client. It has properties and objects defined in the following sections: <a>Script Type</a>, <a>Primary Language</a>, <a>Script Events</a> and, for <a>Dubbing Scripts</a>, <a>Characters</a>.</p>
          <p>A <a>DAPT Script</a> is represented as a TTML document with the structure and constraints also defined in the following sections.</p>

        <p class="note">In the context of this specification rendering could be visual presentation of text,
          for example to show an actor what words to speak, or could be audible playback of an audio resource,

          When mapping a media time expression M to a frame F of a Related Video Object (or Related Media Object), e.g. for the purpose of mixing audio sources signalled by a <a>Document Instance</a> into the main programme audio of the <a>Related Video Object</a>, the presentation processor MUST map M to the frame F with the presentation time that is the closest to, but not less, than M.
        </p>
        <p>
          EXAMPLE 1
          A media time expression of 00:00:05.1 corresponds to frame ceiling( 5.1 × ( 1000 / 1001 × 30) ) = 153 of a <a>Related Video Object</a> with a frame rate of 1000 / 1001 × 30 ≈ 29.97.

        <p class="note">
          In typical scenario, the same video program (the <a>Related Video Object</a>) will be used for <a>Document Instance</a> authoring, delivery and user playback.
          The mapping from media time expression to <a>Related Video Object</a> above allows the author to precisely associate <a>audio description</a> content with video frames, e.g. around existing audio dialogue and sound effects.
          In circumstances where the video program is downsampled during delivery, the application can specify that, at playback, the relative video object be considered the delivered video program upsampled to is original rate, thereby allowing audio content to be presented at the same temporal locations it was authored.

      <h2>Scope</h2>
      <p>This specification defines a text-based profile of the Timed Text Markup Language version 2.0 [[TTML2]]
        intended to support <a>dubbing</a> and <a>audio description</a> workflows worldwide,
        to meet the requirements defined in [[?DAPT-REQS]], and to permit usage of visual presentation
        features within [[TTML2]] and its profiles, for example those in [[TTML-IMSC1.2]].</p>
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>Transcripts and Scripts</h3>
        <p>In general usage, one meaning of the word <em>script</em> is
          the written text of a film, television programme, play etc.
          A script can be either a record of the completed production,
          also known as a transcript,
          or as a plan for a yet to be created production.
          In this document, we use domain-specific terms, and define more specifically that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>a <dfn>transcript</dfn> is the text representation of <em>pre-existing</em> media in another form,
            for example the dialogue in a video;</li>
          <li>a <dfn>script</dfn> is a text representation of the <em>intended</em> content of media prior to its creation,
        for example to guide an actor in recording an audio track.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The term <a>DAPT script</a> is used generically to refer to both <a>transcripts</a> and <a>scripts</a>,
          and is a point of conformance to the formal requirements of this specification.
          <a>DAPT Scripts</a> consist of timed text and associated metadata,
          such as the character speaking.</p>
        <p>In dubbing workflows, a <a>transcript</a> is generated and translated to create a <a>script</a>.
          In audio description workflows, a <a>transcript</a> describes the video image,
          and is then used directly as a <a>script</a> for recording an audio equivalent.
        </p>
        <p>DAPT is a TTML-based format for the exchange of <a>transcripts</a> and <a>scripts</a>
          (i.e. <a>DAPT Scripts</a>)
          among authoring, prompting and playback tools in the localization and <a>audio description</a> pipelines.
          A <a>DAPT document</a> is a serializable form of a <a>DAPT Script</a> designed to carry pertinent information for dubbing or <a>audio description</a>
          such as type of <a>DAPT script</a>, dialogue, descriptions, timing, metadata, original language transcribed text, translated text, language information, and audio mixing instructions,
          and to be extensible to allow user-defined annotations or additional future features.</p>
        <p>This specification defines the data model for <a>DAPT scripts</a> and
          its representation as a [[TTML2]] document (see [[[#data-model]]])
          with some constraints and restrictions (see [[[#profile-constraints]]]).</p>
        <p>A <a>DAPT script</a> is expected to be used to make audio visual media accessible
          or localized for users who cannot understand it in its original form,
          and to be used as part of the solution for meeting user needs
          involving <a>transcripts</a>, including accessibility needs described in [[media-accessibility-reqs]],
          as well as supporting users who need dialogue translated into a different language via dubbing.</p>
        <p>The authoring workflow for both dubbing and audio description involves similar stages,
          that share common requirements as described in [[DAPT-REQS]].
          In both cases, the author reviews the content and
          writes down what is happening, either in the dialogue or in the video image,
          alongside the time when it happens.
          Further transformation processes can change the text to a different language and
          adjust the wording to fit precise timing constraints.
          Then there is a stage in which an audio rendering of the <a>script</a> is generated,
          for eventual mixing into the programme audio.
          That mixing can occur prior to distribution,
          or in the player directly.</p>
        <section>
          <h4>Dubbing <a>scripts</a></h4>
          <p>The <dfn>dubbing</dfn> process which consists in creating a <a>dubbing script</a>
            is a complex, multi-step process involving:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Transcribing and timing the dialogue in its own language from a completed programme to create a <a>transcript</a>;</li>
            <li>Notating dialogue with character information and other annotations;</li>
            <li>Generating localization notes to guide further adaptation;</li>
            <li>Translating the dialogue to a target language <a>script</a>;</li>
            <li>Adapting the translation to the dubbing;
              for example matching the actor’s lip movements in the case of dubs.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>A <dfn>dubbing script</dfn> is a <a>transcript</a> or <a>script</a>
            (depending on workflow stage) used for
            recording translated dialogue to be mixed with the non-dialogue programme audio,
            to generate a localized version of the programme in a different language,
            known as a dubbed version, or dub for short.</p>
          <p><a>Dubbing scripts</a> can be useful as a starting point for creation of subtitles or closed captions in alternate languages.
            This specification is designed to facilitate the addition of, and conversion to,
            subtitle and caption documents in other profiles of TTML, such as [[TTML-IMSC1.2]],
            for example by permitting subtitle styling syntax to be carried in <a>DAPT documents</a>.
            Alternatively, styling can be applied to assist voice artists when recording scripted dialogue.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h4>Audio Description <a>scripts</a></h4>
          <p>Creating audio description content is also a multi-stage process.
            An <dfn>audio description</dfn>,
            also known as video description
            or in [[media-accessibility-reqs]] as <a data-cite="media-accessibility-reqs#described-video">described video</a>,
            is an audio service
            to assist viewers who can not fully see a visual presentation to understand the content.
            It is the result of mixing the <a>main programme audio</a> with the audio rendition of each <a>description</a>,
            authored to be timed when it does not clash with dialogue,
            to deliver an audio description mixed audio track.
            <dfn>Main programme audio</dfn> refers to the audio associated with the programme prior to any further mixing.
            A <dfn>description</dfn> is a set of words that describes an aspect of the programme presentation,
            suitable for rendering into audio by means of vocalisation and recording
            or used as a text alternative source for text to speech translation, as defined in [[WCAG22]].
            More information about what <a>audio description</a> is and how it works can be found at [[BBC-WHP051]].
          </p>
          <p>Writing the audio description <a>script</a> typically involves:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>watching the video content of the programme,
            or series of programmes,</li>
            <li>identifying the key moments during which there is an opportunity to speak descriptions,</li>
            <li>writing the description text to explain the important visible parts of the programme at that time,</li>
            <li>creating an audio version of the descriptions, either by recording a human actor or using text to speech,</li>
            <li>defining mixing instructions (applied using [[TTML2]] audio styling) for combining the audio with the programme audio.</li>
          </ul> 
          <p>The audio mixing can occur prior to distribution of the media,
            or in the client.
            If the <a>audio description</a> <a>script</a> is delivered to the player,
            the text can be used to provide an alternative rendering,
            for example on a Braille display,
            or using the user's configured screen reader.

        <section>
          <h4>Other uses</h4>
          <p>
            <a>DAPT Scripts</a> can be useful in other workflows and scenarios.
            For example, <a>Original language transcripts</a> could be used as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>the output format of a speech to text system, even if not intended for translation,
              or for the production of subtitles or captions;</li>
            <li>a document known in the broadcasting industry as a "post production script",
              used primarily for preview, editorial review and sales purposes;</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Both <a>Original language transcripts</a> and <a>Translated transcripts</a> could be used as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>an accessible transcript presented alongside audio or video in a web page or application;
              in this usage, the timings could be retained and used for synchronisation with,
              or navigation within, the media
              or discarded to present a plain text version of the entire timeline.</li>
          </ul>

      </section> <!-- intro-overview -->

      <section>
        <h3>Example documents</h3>
        <h4>Basic document structure</h4>
        <p>The top level structure of a document is as follows:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>The <code>&lt;tt&gt;</code> root element in the namespace <code>http://www.w3.org/ns/ttml</code> indicates that this is a TTML document
          and the <a><code>ttp:contentProfiles</code></a> attribute indicates that it adheres to the DAPT <a>content profile</a> defined in this specification.</li>
          <li>The <code>daptm:workflowType</code> attribute indicates the type of workflow.</li>
          <li>The <code>daptm:scriptType</code> attribute indicates the type of <a>transcript</a> or <a>script</a>
          but in this empty example, it is not relevant, since only the structure of the document is shown.</li>
          <li>The <a><code>daptm:langSrc</code></a> attribute indicates the default text language source,
            for example the original language of the content,
            while the <code>xml:lang</code> attribute indicates the default language 
            in this script, which in this case is the same.
            Both of these attributes are inherited and can be overridden within the content of the document.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The structure is applicable to all types of <a>DAPT scripts</a>, dubbing or <a>audio description</a>.</p>
        <pre class="example"
          data-include="examples/intro-top-level.xml"
          data-include-format="text">
        </pre>
        <p>The following examples correspond to the timed text <a>transcripts</a> and <a>scripts</a> produced
          at each stage of the workflow described in [[DAPT-REQS]].</p>
        <p>The first example shows an early stage <a>transcript</a> in which timed opportunities for descriptions
          or transcriptions have been identified but no text has been written:</p>
        <pre class="example"
          data-include="examples/intro-times-only.xml"
          data-include-format="text">
        </pre>
        <p>The following examples will demonstrate different uses in dubbing and audio description workflows.</p>

        <h4>Audio Description Examples</h4>
        <p>When descriptions are added this becomes a <a>Pre-Recording Script</a>.
          Note that in this case, to reflect that most of the audio description content
          transcribes the video image where there is no inherent language,
          the <a>Text Language Source</a>, represented by the <a><code>daptm:langSrc</code></a> attribute,
          is set to the empty string at the top level of the document.
          It would be semantically equivalent to omit the attribute altogether,
          since the default value is the empty string:</p>
        <pre class="example"
          data-include="examples/intro-times-and-text.xml"
          data-include-format="text">
        </pre>
        <p>After creating audio recordings, if not using text to speech, instructions for playback
          mixing can be inserted. For example, The gain of "received" audio can be changed before mixing in
          the audio played from inside the <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> element, smoothly
          animating the value on the way in and returning it on the way out:
        </p>
        <pre class="example"
          data-include="examples/intro-script-with-gain.xml"
          data-include-format="text">
        </pre>
        <p>In the above example, the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element's
          <code>begin</code> attribute defines the time that is the "syncbase" for its child, 
          so the times on the <code>&lt;animate&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>
          elements are relative to 25s here.
          The first <code>&lt;animate&gt;</code> element drops the gain from 1
          to 0.39 over 0.3s, freezing that value after it ends,
          and the second one raises it back in the
          final 0.3s of this description. Then the <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> element is
          timed to begin only after the first audio dip has finished.</p>
        <p>If the audio recording is long and just a snippet needs to be played,
        that can be done using <code>clipBegin</code> and <code>clipEnd</code>.
        If we just want to play the part of the audio from file from 5s to
        8s it would look like:</p>
        <pre class="example"
          data-include="examples/intro-script-with-audio-clipped.xml"
          data-include-format="text">
        </pre>
        <p>Or audio attributes can be added to trigger the text to be spoken:
        </p>
        <pre class="example"
          data-include="examples/intro-script-with-speak.xml"
          data-include-format="text">
        </pre>
        <p>It is also possible to embed the audio directly,
          so that a single document contains the <a>script</a> and
          recorded audio together:
        </p>
        <pre class="example"
          data-include="examples/intro-script-with-embedded-audio.xml"
          data-include-format="text">
        </pre>

        <h4>Dubbing Examples</h4>
        <p>From the basic structure of <a href="#example-1"></a>, 
          transcribing the audio produces an original language dubbing <a>transcript</a>,
          which can look as follows.
          No specific style or layout is defined, and here the focus is on the transcription of the dialogue.
          Characters are identified within the <code>&lt;metadata&gt;</code> element.
          Note that the language and the <a>text language source</a> are defined using
          <code>xml:lang</code> and <a><code>daptm:langSrc</code></a> attributes respectively,
          which have the same value
          because the transcript is not translated.</p>
        <pre class="example"
          data-include="examples/intro-original-language.xml"
          data-include-format="text">
        </pre>

        <p>After translating the text, the document is modified. It includes translation text, and
        in this case the original text is preserved. The main document's <a>default language</a> is changed to indicate
        that the focus is on the translated language.
        The combination of the <code>xml:lang</code> and <a><code>daptm:langSrc</code></a> attributes are used
        to mark the text as being original or translated.
        In this case, they are present on both the <code>&lt;tt&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>
        elements to make the example easier to read, but it would also be possible to omit
        them in some cases, making use of the inheritance model:</p>
        <pre class="example"
          data-include="examples/intro-original-language-with-dub-language.xml"
          data-include-format="text">
        </pre>

        <p>The process of adaptation, before recording, could adjust the wording and/or add further timing to assist in the recording.
        The <code>daptm:scriptType</code> attribute is also modified, as in the following example:</p>
        <pre class="example"
          data-include="examples/intro-original-language-with-dub-language-and-adaptation.xml"
          data-include-format="text">

      <h2>Documentation Conventions</h2>
      <p>
        This document uses the following conventions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>When referring to an [[XML]] element in the prose,
          angled brackets and a specific style are used as follows: <code>&lt;someElement&gt;</code>.
          The entity is also described as an element in the prose.
          If the name of an element referenced in this specification
          is not namespace qualified, then the TT namespace applies (see <a href="#namespaces">Namespaces</a>).</li>
        <li>When referring to an [[XML]] attribute in the prose,
          the attribute name is given with its prefix,
          or without a prefix if the attribute is in the global namespace.
          Attributes are styled as follows: <code>attributePrefix:attributeName</code>.
          The entity is also described as an attribute in the prose.</li>
        <li>When defining new [[XML]] attributes, this specification uses the conventions used for
        "value syntax expressions" in [[TTML2]]. For example, the following would define a new attribute
        called <code>daptm:foo</code> as a string with two possible values:
        <code>bar</code> and <code>baz</code>.
          <div class="exampleInner">
            <pre class="language-abnf">
  daptm:foo
    : "bar"
    | "baz"
            </pre>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>When referring to the position of an element or attribute in the [[XML]] document,
          the [[XPath]] <a data-cite="XPath#location-paths"><code>LocationPath</code></a> notation is used.
          For example, to refer to the first <code>&lt;metadata&gt;</code> element child of
          the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element child of
          the <code>&lt;tt&gt;</code> element,
          the following path would be used:
          <code>/tt/head/metadata[0]</code>.
        </li>
        <li><a>Registry sections</a> that include registry table data are indicated as follows:
          <div class="registry-table-section">
            <p>Content in registry table sections has different requirements
              for updates than other Recommendation track content,
              as defined in [[w3c-process]].

      <h3>DAPT Script</h3>
        <p>A <dfn>DAPT Script</dfn> is a <a>transcript</a> or <a>script</a>
          that corresponds to a document processed within an authoring workflow or processed by a client,
          and conforms to the constraints of this specification.
          It has properties and objects defined in the following sections:
          <a>Workflow Type</a>, <a>Script Type</a>, <a>Default Language</a>, <a>Text Language Source</a>, <a>Script Events</a>
          and, for <a>Dubbing Scripts</a>, <a>Characters</a>.</p>
        <p>A <dfn>DAPT Document</dfn> is a TTML <a>Document Instance</a> representing a <a>DAPT Script</a>.
          A <a>DAPT Document</a> has the structure and constraints defined in the following sections.</p>
        <section>
          <h4>Workflow Type</h4>
          <p>The <dfn>Workflow Type</dfn> property is a mandatory property of a <a>DAPT Script</a> which
            indicates if the workflow is for Dubbing or Audio Description.
          </p>
          <p>To represent this property, the <dfn><code>daptm:workflowType</code></dfn> attribute MUST be present on the <code>&lt;tt&gt;</code> element:</p>
          <div class="exampleInner">
            <pre class="language-abnf">
  daptm:workflowType
    : "dubbing"
    | "audioDescription"
            </pre>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h4>Default Language</h4>
          <p>The <dfn>Default Language</dfn> is a mandatory property of a <a>DAPT Script</a>
            which represents the default language for the <a>Text</a> content of <a>Script Events</a>.
            This language may be one of the original languages or a <a>Translation</a> language.
            When it represents a <a>Translation</a> language, it may be the final language
            for which a dubbing or audio description <a>script</a> is being prepared,
            called the <dfn>Target Recording Language</dfn> or it may be an intermediate, or pivot, language
            used in the workflow.
          </p>

          <p>The <a>Default Language</a> is represented in a <a>DAPT Document</a> by the following structure and constraints:
            <ul>
              <li>the <code>xml:lang</code> attribute MUST be present on the <code>&lt;tt&gt;</code> element and its value MUST NOT be empty.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p class="note">All text content in a <a>DAPT Script</a> has a specified language.
            When multiple languages are used, the <a>Default Language</a> can correspond to the language of the majority of <a>Script Events</a>,
            to the language being spoken for the longest duration, or to a language arbitrarily chosen by the author.</p>
          <aside class="example">An <a>Original Language Transcript</a> of dialogue is prepared for a video
            containing dialogue in Danish and Swedish.
            The <a>Default Language</a> is set to Danish by setting <code>xml:lang="da"</code> on the <code>&lt;tt&gt;</code> element.
            <a>Script Events</a> that contain Swedish <a>Text</a> override this by setting
            <code>xml:lang="sv"</code> on the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element.
            <a>Script Events</a> that contain Danish <a>Text</a> can set the <code>xml:lang</code> attribute
            or omit it, since the inherited language is the <a>Default Language</a> of the document.
            In both cases the Script Events' <a>Text</a> objects are <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> elements that represent untranslated
            content that had an inherent language (in this case dialogue)
            and therefore set the <a><code>daptm:langSrc</code></a> attribute to their source language,
            implying that they are in the <a>Original</a> language.</aside>
        </section>


        <section>
          <h4>Script Type</h4>
          <p>The <dfn>Script Type</dfn> property is a mandatory property of a <a>DAPT Script</a>
            which describes the type of documents used in Dubbing and Audio Description workflows,
            among the following:
            <a>Original Language Transcript</a>,
            <a>Translated Transcript</a>,
            <a>Pre-recording Script</a>,
            <a>As-recorded Script</a>.</p>
          <p>To represent this property, the <dfn><code>daptm:scriptType</code></dfn> attribute MUST be present on the <code>&lt;tt&gt;</code> element:</p>
          <div class="exampleInner">
            <pre class="language-abnf">
  daptm:scriptType

    | "preRecording"
    | "asRecorded"
            </pre>
          </div>

          <p>The definitions of the types of documents and the corresponding <code>daptm:scriptType</code> attribute values are:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <dfn>Original Language Transcript</dfn>:
                <p>When the <code>daptm:scriptType</code> attribute value is <code>originalTranscript</code>,
                the document is a literal transcription of the dialogue and/or on-screen text in their inherent spoken/written language(s),
                or of non-dialogue sounds and non-linguistic visual content.</p>
                <p><a>Script Events</a> in this type of <a>transcript</a> SHOULD contain
                  <a>Original</a> <a>Text</a> objects

              <aside class="example">If a programme contains dialogue in English and Hebrew,
                the <a>Original Language Transcript</a> will contain some <a>Script Events</a> in English and some in Hebrew,
                all containing <a>Original</a> <a>Text</a> objects.
                The document contains no <a>Translation</a> <a>Text</a> objects.</aside>

                <dfn>Translated Transcript</dfn>:
                <p>When the <code>daptm:scriptType</code> attribute value is <code>translatedTranscript</code>,
                the document represents a translation of the <a>Original Language Transcript</a> in a common language.</p>
                <p>It can be adapted to produce a <a>Pre-Recording Script</a>,
                  and/or used as the basis for a further translation into the <a>Target Recording Language</a>.</p> 
                <p><a>Script Events</a> in this type of <a>transcript</a> SHOULD contain
                  <a>Translation </a><a>Text</a> objects.
                  They MAY also contain <a>Original</a> <a>Text</a> objects.</p>
                <aside class="example">If a programme contains dialogue in English and Hebrew,
                  the French <a>Translated Transcript</a> will contain at least the translation in French of all <a>Script Events</a>.
                  It may still retain text content in Hebrew and English to assist further processing.</aside>
                <aside class="example">If an <a>audio description</a> <a>Original Language Transcript</a> contains
                  <a>Original</a> language <a>Script Events</a> that describe in-image text content,
                  and the desired <a>audio description</a> output needs to be in a different language,
                  the <a>Text</a> objects can be <a>Translation</a> <a>Text</a> objects.
                  In that case, it is appropriate to mark the transcript as a <a>Translated Transcript</a>.
                  It may also be appropriate, as part of the translation activity, to describe within the translated text
                  content the original language of that text, to inform the audience,
                  for example, &quot;A Japanese newspaper headline that means: sailor completes ocean crossing&quot;.

                <p>When the <code>daptm:scriptType</code> attribute value is <code>preRecording</code>,
                the document represents the result of the adaptation of an <a>Original Language Transcript</a> or
                a <a>Translated Transcript</a> for recording, e.g. for better lip-sync in a dubbing workflow,
                or to ensure that the words can fit within the time available in an audio description workflow.</p>
                <p><a>Script Events</a> in this type of <a>script</a> SHOULD contain <a>Text</a> objects

                  in the case that their language is not the <a>Target Recording Language</a>, 
                  for context, to assist further processing.</p>

                <aside class="note">The <a>Script Type</a> of a <a>DAPT Script</a> cannot necessarily be detected
                  by inspecting the text content of the document.

                  can consist in replacing some words in the text content of a <a>Script Event</a> without altering the rest of the document.
                  In either case, <a>Translation</a> <a>Text</a> objects

            <li>a mandatory <dfn data-lt="Character Identifier">Identifier</dfn>
            which is a unique identifier used to reference the character from elsewhere in the document,

            <li>a mandatory <dfn data-lt="Character Name">Name</dfn> which is the name of the <a>Character</a> in the programme</li>
            <li>an optional <dfn data-lt="Character Talent Name">Talent Name</dfn>, which is the name of the actor speaking dialogue for this <a>Character</a>.</li>
          </ul>

        <p>A <a>Character</a> is represented in a <a>DAPT Document</a> by the following structure and constraints:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>If it is empty, the <a>Text</a> represents content without an inherent language,
            such as untranslated descriptions of a visual scene or

                There may be a use case for embedding audio data,
                since it makes the single document a portable (though large)
                entity that can be exchanged and transferred with no concern for missing resources,
                and no need for e.g. manifest files.
                If we do not need to support referenced embedded audio then only the last option is needed,
                and is probably the simplest to implement.
                One case for referenced embedded audio is that it more easily allows reuse of the
                same audio in different document locations, though that seems like an unlikely
                requirement in this use case. Another is that it means that all embedded audio is in
                an easily located part of the document in <code>tt/head/resources</code>, which
                potentially could carry an implementation benefit?

        <h3>Foreign Elements and Attributes</h3>
        <p>
          A <a>DAPT Document</a> MAY contain elements and attributes that are neither specifically permitted nor forbidden by a profile.
        </p>
        <p class ="note">
          <a>DAPT Documents</a> remain subject to the content conformance requirements specified at Section 3.1 of [[TTML2]].
          In particular, a <a>DAPT Document</a> can contain elements and attributes not in any TT namespace, i.e. in foreign namespaces, since such elements and attributes are pruned by the algorithm at Section 4 of [[TTML2]] prior to evaluating content conformance.
        </p>
        <p class ="note">
          For validation purposes it is good practice to define and use a content specification for all foreign namespace elements and attributes used within a <a>DAPT Document</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <a>transformation processor</a> SHOULD preserve such elements or attributes whenever possible.

        <h3>Related Media Object (TTML)</h3>
        <p>Within DAPT, the common language terms audio and video are used in the context of a programme.
          The audio and video are each a part of what is defined in [[TTML2]] as the
          <dfn data-cite="TTML2#terms-related-media-object">Related Media Object</dfn> that
          provides the media timeline and is the source of the <a>main programme audio</a>,
          and any visual timing references needed when adjusting timings relevant to the video image,
          such as for lip synchronization.</p>
          <div class="example note">
          <p>A <a>DAPT document</a> can identify the programme acting
          as the <a>Related Media Object</a> using metadata. For example, it is possible
          to use the <code>&lt;ebuttm:sourceMediaIdentifier&gt;</code> element defined in [[EBU-TT-3390]].</p>
          <pre class="xml" data-include="examples/sourceMediaIdentifier.xml" data-include-format="text"></pre>
          </div>

      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Synchronization</h3>
        <p>
          If the <a>DAPT Document</a> is intended to be used as the basis for producing
          an [[TTML-IMSC1.2]] document,
          the synchronization provisions of [[TTML-IMSC1.2]] apply
          in relation to the video.
        </p>
        <p>Timed content within the <a>DAPT Document</a> is intended to be rendered
          starting and ending on specific audio samples.</p>
        <p class="note">In the context of this specification rendering could be visual presentation of text,
          for example to show an actor what words to speak, or could be audible playback of an audio resource,
          or could be physical or haptic, such as a Braille display.
        </p>
        <p>In constrained applications, such as real-time audio mixing and playback,
          if accurate synchronization to the audio sample cannot be achieved in the rendered output,
          the combined effects of authoring and playback inaccuracies in
          timed changes in presentation SHOULD meet the synchronization requirements
          of [[EBU-R37]], i.e. audio changes are not to precede image changes by
          more than 40ms, and are not to follow them by more than 60ms.</p>
        <p>Likewise, authoring applications SHOULD allow authors to meet the
          requirements of [[EBU-R37]] by defining times with an accuracy
          such that changes to audio are less than 15ms after any associated change in
          the video image, and less than 5ms before any associated change in the video image.  
        </p>
        <p>Taken together, the above two constraints on overall presentation and
          on <a>DAPT documents</a> intended for real-time playback mean that
          <a>content processors</a> SHOULD complete audio presentation changes
          no more than 35ms before the time specified in the <a>DAPT document</a>
          and no more than 45ms after the time specified.</p>

        <h3>Profile Signaling</h3>
        This section defines how a TTML <a>Document Instance</a> signals that it is a <a>DAPT Document</a>
        and how it signals any processing requirements that apply.
        See also <a href="#conformance-of-dapt-documents"></a>, which defines how to

          <p>The <dfn data-cite="TTML2#profile-attribute-contentProfiles"><code>ttp:contentProfiles</code></dfn> attribute
            is used to declare the [[TTML2]] profiles to which the document conforms.</p>
          <p>TTML documents representing DAPT Scripts MUST specify a <a><code>ttp:contentProfiles</code></a> attribute
            on the <code>&lt;tt&gt;</code> element including one value equal to the
            <a>DAPT 1.0 Content Profile</a> designator.
            Other values MAY be present to declare conformance to other profiles of [[TTML2]],
            and MAY include profile designators in proprietary namespaces.</p>

          <h4><code>ttp:profile</code></h4>
          <p>The <dfn data-cite="TTML2#profile-attribute-profile"><code>ttp:profile</code></dfn> attribute
            is a mechanism within [[?TTML1]] for declaring the processing requirements for a <a>Document Instance</a>.
            It has effectively been superceded in [[TTML2]] by <a><code>ttp:processorProfiles</code></a>.</p>
          <p>TTML documents representing DAPT Scripts MUST NOT specify a <code>ttp:profile</code> attribute
            on the <code>&lt;tt&gt;</code> element.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h4><code>ttp:processorProfiles</code></h4>
          <p>The <dfn data-cite="TTML2#profile-attribute-processorProfiles"><code>ttp:processorProfiles</code></dfn> attribute
            is used to declare the processing requirements for a <a>Document Instance</a>.</p>
          <p>TTML documents representing DAPT Scripts MAY specify a <a><code>ttp:processorProfiles</code></a> attribute
            on the <code>&lt;tt&gt;</code> element.
            If present, the <a><code>ttp:processorProfiles</code></a> attribute MUST include one value equal to
            the designator of the <a>DAPT 1.0 Processor Profile</a>.
            Other values MAY be present to declare additional processing constraints, 
            and MAY include profile designators in proprietary namespaces.</p>
          <p class="note">The <a><code>ttp:processorProfiles</code></a> attribute can be used
            to signal that features and extensions in additional profiles
            need to be supported to process the <a>Document Instance</a> successfully.
            For example, a local workflow might introduce particular metadata requirements,
            and signal that the processor needs to support those by using an additional
            processor profile designator.</p>
          <p class="note">If the content author does not need to signal that
            additional processor requirements than those defined by DAPT
            are needed to process the <a>DAPT document</a> then the

        <section>
          <h4>Other TTML2 Profile Vocabulary</h4>
          <p>[[TTML2]] specifies a vocabulary and semantics that can be used to define the set of <a>features</a>
            that a <a>document instance</a> can make use of, or that a processor needs to support,
            known as a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ttml2/#profile">Profile</a>.</p>
          <p>Except where specified, it is not a requirement of DAPT that this profile vocabulary is supported by
            processors; nevertheless such support is permitted.</p>
          <p>The majority of this profile vocabulary is used to indicate how a processor can compute the set of features
            that it needs to support in order to process the <a>Document Instance</a> successfully.
            The vocabulary is itself defined in terms of TTML2 features.
            Those profile-related features are listed within <a href="#profiles"></a> as being optional. 
            They MAY be implemented in processors
            and their associated vocabulary
            MAY be present in <a>Document Instances</a>.
          </p>
          <p class="note">Unless processor support for these features and vocabulary has been
            arranged (using an out-of-band protocol), the vocabulary is not expected to be present.</p>
          <p>The additional profile-related vocabulary for which processor support is
            not required (but is permitted) in DAPT is:</p>
          <ul>

          <p>This means that the beginning of the document timeline,

        </section> <!-- timebase-section -->
        <section>
          <h4><code>timeContainer</code></h4>
          <p>The only permitted value of the <code>timeContainer</code> attribute is the default value, <code>par</code>.</p>
          <p>Documents SHOULD omit the <code>timeContainer</code> attribute on all elements.</p>
          <p>Documents MUST NOT set the <code>timeContainer</code> attribute to any value other than <code>par</code> on any element.</p>
          <p class="note">This means that the <code>begin</code> attribute value for every timed element is relative to
            the computed begin time of its parent element,
            or for the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element, to time zero.</p>

        <div class="note">Layout of the paragraphs may rely on the default TTML region (i.e. if no <code>&lt;layout&gt;</code> element is used in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element) or may be explicit by the use of the <code>region</code> attribute, to refer to a <code>&lt;region&gt;</code> element present at <code>/tt/head/layout/region</code>.</div>

        <h4>Bidirectional text</h4>
        <p>
          The following metadata elements are permitted in DAPT and specified in [[TTML2]] as containing <code>#PCDATA</code>,
          i.e. text data only with no element content.
          Where bidirectional text is required within the character content within such an element,
          Unicode control characters can be used to define the base direction within arbitrary ranges of text. 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>&lt;ttm:copyright&gt;</code></li>

          <li><code>&lt;ttm:title&gt;</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note">More guidance about usage of this mechanism is available at <a data-cite="I18N-INLINE-BIDI#nomarkup"></a>.</p>
        <p>The <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> content elements permit the direction of text
          to be specified using the <code>tts:direction</code> and <code>tts:unicodeBidi</code> attributes.
          Document authors should use this more robust mechanism rather than using Unicode control characters.</p>
        <div class="note">
          <p>The following example taken from [[TTML2]] demonstrates the syntax for bidirectional text markup within

    <p>[[TTML2]] specifies a formal language for expressing document and processor requirements,
      within the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ttml2/#vocabulary-profiling">Profiling</a> sub-system.
      The normative requirements of this specification are defined using the conformance terminology
      described above, and are also defined using this TTML2 profile mechanism.
      Where TTML2 vocabulary is referenced, the syntactic and semantic requirements relating to that
      vocabulary as defined in [[TTML2]] apply.</p>
    <p>Whilst there is no requirement for a DAPT processor to implement the
      TTML2 profile processing semantics in general,
      implementers can use the TTML2 profiles defined in <a href="#profiles"></a>
      as a means of verifying that their implementations meet the normative requirements
      of DAPT, for example as a checklist.
    </p>
    <p>Conversely, a general purpose [[TTML2]] processor that does support the TTML2
      profile processing semantics can use the TTML2 profiles defined in <a href="#profiles"></a>
      directly to determine if it is capable of processing a <a>DAPT document</a>.

        Those provisions are expressed using the

    <p>With the exception of the following, the privacy considerations of [[ttml2]] apply:</p>

      <li>Appendix P.3 (Resource Fetching), where only the considerations relating to the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element apply.</li>
      <li>Appendix P.7 (Access to Processing State) does not apply, since no support for the <code>condition</code> attribute is required.</li>

      <h3>Personal Information</h3>
      <p>DAPT documents typically contain the names of characters or people who feature within the associated media,
        either fictional or real.
        In general this information would be present within the media itself or be public via other routes.
        If there is sensitivity associated with their being known to people with access to
        the DAPT documents in which their identity is contained,
        then such access should be managed with appropriate confidentiality.
        For example those documents could be available within a closed authoring environment and
        edited to remove the sensitive information prior to distribution to a wider audience.
        If this scenario arises, information security good practices within the closed environment should be applied,
        such as encryption of the document "at rest" and when being moved,
        access controlled by authentication platforms, etc.

        DAPT documents can reference a set of alternate external audio resources for the same fragment of audio,
        where the processor is expected to select one of the alternatives based on features such as format support.
        If this pattern is used, it is possible that the processor's choice of audio resource,
        being exposed to the origin, reveals information about that processor, such as its preferred audio format.

      <aside class="note">
        Document authors and content providers can avoid referencing external audio resources by embedding
        the audio resources within the document.

    <h2>Audio Mixing</h2>

    <p>Applying the <a>Mixing Instructions</a> can be implemented using [[webaudio]].
      <a href="#audio-mixing-figure"></a> shows the flow of programme audio,
      and how, when audio-generating elements are active,
      the pan and gain (if set) on the <a>Script Event</a> are applied,
      then the output is passed to the <a>Text</a>,
      which mixes in the audio from any active <a>Audio Recording</a>,
      itself subject to its own <a>Mixing Instructions</a>,
      then the result has the <a>Text</a>'s <a>Mixing Instructions</a>
      applied, prior to the output being mixed on to the master bus.

      <li>the application of <em>animated</em> <a>Mixing Instructions</a> is not
        shown explicitly. [[webaudio]] supports the timed variation of
        input parameters to its nodes: it is possible to translate the
        TTML <code>&lt;animate&gt;</code> element semantics directly into
        [[webaudio]] API calls to achieve the equivalent effect.</li>

      <p>The following sections define <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ttml2/#terms-extension">extension</a> designations,
        expressed as relative URIs (fragment identifiers)
        relative to the <a>DAPT Extension</a> Namespace base URI.
        These extension designations are used in <a href="#profiles"></a>
        to describe the normative provisions of DAPT that are not expressed
        by [[TTML2]] profile features.
